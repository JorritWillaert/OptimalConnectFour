OptimalConnectFour
====================

Play Connect Four with a friend or against an optimal AI.\
Sidenote: You will never be able to win from a superintelligent AI...

### Usage
```
$ python play.py
```

### Game options
###### Option 1: Duo player mode
Play Connect Four against your friend.

###### Option 2: Single player mode
Play Connect Four against an optimal AI.

Remark: The computing time for the most optimal move will be very high if you play against the AI in the standard settings (i.e. a width of 7 fields, a height of 6). Therefore, an option has been provided to play on a smaller board.
